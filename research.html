  I designed and built a magnetic spectrometer (depicted to the right), known as the GSPEC (Global Spectrometer for Positron and Electron Characterization). This instrument is suitable for detecting electrons and positrons with energies from 3 MeV to 150 MeV. The resolution of the GSPEC is maximized between 5 and 12 MeV to constrain the temperature of hot electron distributions generated in high-intensity laser-solid interactions. The GSPEC significantly expanded the charged-particle detection suite available at the Texas Petawatt Laser and has been successfully fielded in experiments both there and at the Titan laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Jupiter Laser Facility.
