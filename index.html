  I am a PhD student in the Stanford Department of Applied Physics. My research, conducted in the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory 
  High Energy Density Science Division, focuses on developing sources of laser-driven ion and neutron beams using cryogenic liquid jet 
  targets developed by our group.
