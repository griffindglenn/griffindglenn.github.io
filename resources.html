<h2>Graduate School Applications</h2>
<p>
  Applying to graduate school is a challenging process, but it doesn't have to be scary or discouraging. In the interest of helping younger members of the Dean's Scholars Honors Program navigate their applications to graduate school, my friend <a href="https://maikemorrison.com/">Maike Morrison</a> and I wrote <a href="https://griffindglenn.github.io/GradAppGuide_MM_GG.pdf">a guide to the process</a>. Highlights include:
  <ul>
  	<li> A timeline beginning in the first year of undergrad</li>
  	<li> Summaries of necessary materials</li>
  	<li>A detailed discussion of both the application and visit process for programs with and without interviews</li>
  </ul>
  We hope you find this document helpful! We tried to share important wisdom older students had passed down to us as well as additional tidbits we wished we'd known as we applied.
