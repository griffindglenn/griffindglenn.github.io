I am a PhD student in the Stanford Department of Applied Physics. My research, conducted in the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory High Energy Density Science Division, focuses on developing sources of laser-driven ion and neutron beams using cryogenic liquid jet targets developed by our group.

I am advised by [Siegfried Glenzer](https://heds.slac.stanford.edu/about/people "Siegfried Glenzer") and supported by a DOE NNSA Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship. I was previously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I received a BS in physics and a BA in Plan II Honors from The University of Texas at Austin, where I worked with the Texas Petawatt Laser under the mentorship of [Todd Ditmire](https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/423-ditmire-todd?Itemid=349 "Todd Ditmire"). My CV is available <a href="GDGlenn_CV.pdf" >here</a>.
