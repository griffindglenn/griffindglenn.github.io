I am a PhD student in the Stanford Department of Applied Physics. My research, conducted in the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory High Energy Density Science Division, focuses on developing sources of laser-driven ion and neutron beams using cryogenic liquid jet targets developed by our group.

I am advised by Siegfried Glenzer and supported by a DOE NNSA Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship. I was previously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I received a BS in physics and a BA in Plan II Honors from UT Austin, where I worked with Todd Ditmire. My CV is available here.
