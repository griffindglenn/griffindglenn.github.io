  I was named one of 32 Dean's Honored Graduates from the UT Austin College of Natural Sciences in 2019. Less than one percent of the graduating class of the college is selected for this award, which is the highest honor given to graduating seniors from the College of Natural Sciences. It recognizes excellence in the classroom as well as substantial achievement in scientific research, an independent intellectual pursuit, or exceptional service and leadership to the college and university.
