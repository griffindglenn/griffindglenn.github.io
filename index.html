<h1 id="header-1">About</h1>

<p>
  I'm a PhD student in the Stanford University Department of Applied Physics, and I do plasma physics research as a member of the High Energy Density Science Division at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. My work specifically focuses on generating laser-driven ion and neutron beams and using them to better understand the properties of plasmas that occur in extreme conditions. To do this, I work with a cryogenic liquid jet target developed by our group and some of the most powerful lasers in the world.

  I am advised by <a href="https://heds.slac.stanford.edu/about/people">Siegfried Glenzer</a> and supported by a DOE NNSA Stewardship 
  Science Graduate Fellowship. I was previously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I did my undergraduate work at The University of Texas at Austin, where I received a BS in physics as a member of the Dean's Scholars Honors Program and a BA 
  in Plan II Honors. My previous research was conducted at the Texas Petawatt Laser under the mentorship of <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/directory/item/423-ditmire-todd">Todd Ditmire</a>.
