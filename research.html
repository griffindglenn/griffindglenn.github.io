<p>
  I designed and built a magnetic spectrometer (depicted to the right), known as the GSPEC (Global Spectrometer for Positron and Electron Characterization). This instrument is suitable for detecting electrons and positrons with energies from 3 MeV to 150 MeV. The resolution of the GSPEC is maximized between 5 and 12 MeV to constrain the temperature of hot electron distributions generated in high-intensity laser-solid interactions. The GSPEC significantly expanded the charged-particle detection suite available at the Texas Petawatt Laser and has been successfully fielded in experiments both there and at the Titan laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Jupiter Laser Facility.

<h2>Tight Focusing of a Petawatt Laser</h2>
<div>
<p>
	I participated in the first experiments focusing the Texas Petawatt Laser using an f/1 off-axis parabola in an effort to reach on-target intensities exceeding 10<sup>22</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup>. We developed a model to characterize the focal spot in detail, taking into account wavefront distortions remaining after optimization with a deformable mirror, near-field irregularities in the spatial profile, and pointing and target alignment uncertainties. The estimated peak intensities obtained with this model were within an acceptable margin of error from the measured peak intensities, allowing us to remain confident that we achieved peak intensities greater than 10<sup>22</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup> at the focal plane.
